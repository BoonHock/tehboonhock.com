							<h2>First "Programming" Language</h2>
							<p>So I decided to learn how to code because I was very interested in it. However, I did not know where to start. I did my research but for god's sake, I did not understand a single f<u>ish</u> those guys were talking about! What the hell is compiler? What the hell is IDE?! What is object-oriented?!! ARGHHHHH!!</p>
							<p>So one guy (I don't remember who) recommended me to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. After navigating around, apparently I should start with HTML first and that's basically how I ended up with HTML. Also, due to difficulties to get internet access, I borrowed an extremely old HTML book from my school's library</p>

							<h2>SAT &amp; SAT Subject Tests</h2>
							<p>To achieve my MIT dream, I took SAT and SAT Subject Tests during my second semester of Form 6. The tests that I took were  <span data-toggle="popover" title="The Actual Reason" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Lack of planning guys. Lack of planning..." style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" class="popovers">somehow very near</span>. I sat for SAT 2 first then about two weeks later, STPM then one week later, SAT 1.</p>

							<h2>Journey to the West</h2>
							<p>MIT! MIT! MIT!!! I wanted to get myself into MIT so bad I strived super hard for my academic and co-curricular achievements to boost my qualification. STPM, SAT 1, SAT 2 and co-curricular activities... Well, here's what I did. Every schooling day (weekdays which are not school holiday), I would go to McDonald's near my home to study around 1:00am. I  went home around 5:30am to prepare for school. After school, I would go to my friend's condominium's swimming pool to start running. Yes. You read that right, RUNNING! The pool was about my waist height and I trained my stamina by running in the pool for 1 hour every day. Then, I would swim for a few laps and continued running on land around the condominium area for another half an hour. After running, I went to my friend's unit to study. Holidays are simpler. I slept until around 10:00am daily and started studying until 5:30pm and went for basketball.</p>
							<p>So when do I sleep? SCHOOL TIME! :D Yeah... I got the bad habit of not paying attention in class. :/</p>

							<h2>Achievement vs Development</h2>
							<p>All the hard work did pay off. I earned various awards and achievements such as School Athlete of the Year, a few basketball championships, district level quizzes, etc. So I thought I stood a pretty decent chance for MIT but I ultimately failed. Thank god I failed! I learnt a lot from this "Journey to the West". I was overly addicted to achievements and awards. How about personal skills? Like, ability to persuade or leadership skills or marketing skills, programming skills, etc. I went after these achievements blindly without desiring something more than winning in return.</p>
							<p>After we got our STPM results, I was selected by my school as one of the recipients of "Outstanding STPM student" award. I rejected it***. I decided that this is the way for me to remind myself that awards and achievements are not a measure of my success. My capabilities are. Of course I did not have to actually reject the award to learn this lesson but I figured that method simply suits me.</p>
							<small>***You have no idea how much effort I spent to reject the award. I actually had to debate my school principal and the teacher in charged of the event for about 15 minutes each. My god...</small>
